# sqd-band-gaps
In this repository we store the code base for the paper "Computing band gaps of periodic materials via sample-based quantum diagonalization" published in https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10901. This repository has two main folders. The folder "hubbard_with_qe" contains the code for the generation of the lattice Hamiltonians, while the folder "sqd-lattice" contains the code for the SQD implementation to solve the lattice Hamiltonians and obtain the band gaps of the analyzed materials. The instructions for usage are found inside the refered folders.
